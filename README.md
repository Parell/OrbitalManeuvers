## The Project

An old project named <a href="https://github.com/cmdrflexo/RocketFOSS">RocketFoss</a> was abandoned so ive decided to carry the torch of opensource, and just build a game.

**Defeat the enemies home base to win.** The concept is simple and allows for multiplayer. Nbody orbital mechanics "no pached conics". Combat will be similar to "Children of a dying star" but more reliant on skill. large but simple scope, World, weapons, and a way to get around. Contributions are what make the open source community great so any contributions made are **appreciated**.

### Roadmap
* Floating origin and Scaled space.
* Nbody physics and Time controllers.
* Trajectories and maneuvers planning.
* Quad sphere and solar system editing.
* Vessel movement and maneuver ploting.
* AI movement and decision making.
